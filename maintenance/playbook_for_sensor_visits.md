This playbook details the steps for in-person maintanance visits to perform quick, reliable firmware updates and quality sensor maintenance.

## Detaching sensor from the mount
In order to detach the sensor, first solar panel, followed by the housing shall be uninstalled. 
### Uninstalling Solar Panel
The solar panel uses a struct nut with M6 hex screw to fasten the panel mount to the struct channel. Unfasten the M6 screw completely detach the panel from the struct channel.

**Note:** _If the panel is installed somewhere else other than the struct channel, this has been done to harvest maximum solar power by being in direct sunlight. Keep a note of this mounting location for re-installing after the maintenance._
