## Introduction
This manual details the sensor quality control at FloodSense. It is meant to be a teaching tool and source of information to build a high quality sensor.

One of the hardware goals of FloodSense is to devise a community-buildable sensor design that meets industry standards - IP67 Waterproof, Weatherproof and is robust.

The objectives of this manual are:
- to provide a reference QC manual to quality inspectors
- to provide a reference QC manual to lab personnel/researchers/community members
- to reduce human error and improve the quality of the sensor by
  - providing detailed steps in order which are easy to follow
  - proper building instructions
  - notes on areas where things might go wrong

## General Laboratory Safety

1. Always use safety goggles while performing drilling or sawing or any other activities where there is a potential danger to the eyes
2. Use care when waterproofing electrical components using liquid electrical tape. Thoroughly wash hands after use.
3. Use care when handling a solder iron. Never touch the element of soldering iron! Please use a cleaning wet sponge during use. Always put the soldering iron on the stand when not in use and never put it on the workbench. Turn it off and unplug when not in use.
4. Do not use a NiMH/NiCad/lead-acid charger while charging LiPo batteries
5. Always inspect batteries and surrounding circuitry for any damage, loose wiring, or possibility of short circuits
