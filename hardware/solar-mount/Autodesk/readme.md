# Original Design

The original design used in field shown above was a nice and sturdy structure. The compact size allowed great flexibility in the various mounting situations. However, a common issue that seemed to come up often was screwing in the base from the back upon installation. Since the solar panel component hangs over the screw hole in the back, one needs to angle a screw driver to properly secure the mount. A difficult feat in field when one is many feet above ground on a ladder. 

# Version 2
The second iteration of the solar panel mount builds on the previous design and addresses issues presented from use in the field. A primary concern of the original solar panel mount design is the difficulty in screwing in at an angle out in the field. To remedy this situation, the base of the mount was extended out. In addition, the hole through which the solar cable is looped through presented a source of tension onto the cable. To alleviate the stress, the hole on the mount was moved down.
