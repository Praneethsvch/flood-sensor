# Design Currently in Field

The design currently being utilized in the field offers great flexibility with it's compact size. However, repeated use in the field has exposed major shortcomings that have hindered sensor installations from going as smoothtly as possible. For starters, the overhang over the base of the sensor makes it incredibly hard to screw in. This feat is difficult as it is to perform due to it being done 6 feet off the ground on a ladder. Having to use an angled screwdriver at the same time does very little to decrease the difficulty level. In addition, several failure analyses on sensors that stop working in the field have revealed the root cause to be the solar panel becoming disconnected from the cable. When handling the solar panels during installation, it is very easy to tug on the cable more aggresively than intended, thus allowing for wires to become disconnected from the panel. 

# Version 2
The second iteration of the solar panel mount builds on the previous design and addresses issues presented from use in the field. A primary concern of the original solar panel mount design is the difficulty in screwing in at an angle out in the field. To remedy this situation, the base of the mount was extended out. In addition, the hole through which the solar cable is looped through presented a source of tension onto the cable. To alleviate the stress, the hole on the mount was moved down.

# Final Version
The final version of the solar panel mount cleaned up the second iteration.
