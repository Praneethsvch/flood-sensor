# Flood Sensor Deployment Manual
Once the sensor deployment location is identified, this manual explains the next steps to deploy a [FloodNet](https://www.floodnet.nyc)'s flood sensor. This is the second stage in deploying a flood sensor, and the first is detailed in the [Flood Hotspots Identification](https://github.com/floodnet-nyc/flood-sensor/blob/main/deployment/hotspot%20identification/flood-hotspots-identification.md) document.

## 1. Things to do - Before leaving the lab
This section details the necessary preperation needed prior to deployment including checklists, mounting preperation, adding the sensor to the TTN app. 
### 1.1. Checklist
This section contains the checklist for necessary tools, hardware, and equipment needed for the sensor deployment procedures.
### 1.2. Notes on Sensor mount preperation
After the mounting infrastructure has been chosen(see [Flood Hotspots Identification](https://github.com/floodnet-nyc/flood-sensor/blob/main/deployment/hotspot%20identification/flood-hotspots-identification.md) document), the next step is to identify the mounting position on the post/pole itself. 

Below are a few examples of different DOT signpost designs found across NYC, explaining optimal sensor placement scenarios. 
### 1.3. Registering sensor on TTN Application

### 1.4. Acquiring FloodNet approval
Sensor locations confirmed in weekly meeting prior to deployment

### 1.5. Acquiring NYC DOT approval
(applicable if on structure other than drive rail which have blanket approval)

## 2. Identifying Optimal Solar Panel Placement
To maximize solar power harvesting, the solar panel shall face South and be exposed to direct sunlight. 

## 3. Sensor Installation Process
The following steps details the sensor installation process to be followed in the field. 
### 3.1. Accessing the infrastructure

### 3.2. Mount installation 

### 3.3. Solar Panel installation

### 3.4. Levelling

## 4. Joining the FloodNet network

## 5. Start Sensing

## 6. Signage
Mounting metal sign on drive rail (two nut and bolt fastners) or placing sticker on other mounting point.

## 7. Photo
Photos of sensor installed on location (for records and use in FieldKit dashboard). Photo should include surrounding area (from approx. 10 feet away).

## 8. Next Steps
After a successful installation, follow the below steps to complete the sensor deployment process:

## Sensor Locations Logged in Database
New sensor locations should be recorded into master spreadsheet as well as deployment map
