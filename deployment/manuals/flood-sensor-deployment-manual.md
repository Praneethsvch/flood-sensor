# Flood Sensor Deployment Manual
Once the sensor deployment location is identified, this manual explains the next steps to deploy a [FloodNet](https://www.floodnet.nyc)'s flood sensor. This is the second stage in deploying a flood sensor, and the first is detailed in the [Flood Hotspots Identification](https://github.com/floodnet-nyc/flood-sensor/blob/main/deployment/hotspot%20identification/flood-hotspots-identification.md) document.

## 1. Things to do - Before leaving the lab

## 2. Notes on Mounting
After the mounting infrastructure has been chosen(see [Flood Hotspots Identification](https://github.com/floodnet-nyc/flood-sensor/blob/main/deployment/hotspot%20identification/flood-hotspots-identification.md) document), the next step is to identify the mounting position on the post/pole itself. 

Below are a few examples of different DOT signpost designs found across NYC, explaining optimal sensor placement scenarios. 

## 3. Identifying Optimal Solar Panel Placement
To maximize solar power harvesting, the solar panel shall face South and be exposed to direct sunlight.
